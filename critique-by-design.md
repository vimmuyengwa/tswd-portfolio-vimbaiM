# The World Happiness Report  

For my data source I chose to analyze the World Happiness Report.  When I first encountered the chart, I was skeptical about how happiness could be measured because it can be highly subjective. Yet alone across 143 countries. Much like the rural participants in the Data is Personal study, my perceptions of how much I could trust this data were influenced by the source once I did some digging. In fact, the research was a collaboration between Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the editorial board of the World Happiness Report. 
This made me reflect on how our interpretation and trust of data is often shaped by our inherent biases particularly after seeing these exemplified in the rural research study. The article emphasized how people tend to interpret data by looking for connections and patterns that resonate with their own perspectives. This highlighted how the way we process information can be deeply influenced by our individual leanings and preconceptions.



_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

Original data visualization:

Instead, they are a way of explaining the implications of the model estimated in Table 2.1. The few countries that have empty bars do not have sufficient information for the calculation of portions explained by individual factors. These countries still have their overall scores, though, which are based entirely on survey responses, and are independent of our efforts to explore the underlying support factors of happiness.

  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
