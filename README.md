# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  My name is Vimbai. My career spans several industries including the manufacturing, non-profit, law, technology, and consulting realms. My journey into the tech world is uniquely non-traditional: I majored in Sociology during my undergraduate studies. This background profoundly shaped my worldview, instilling a deep commitment to making a meaningful impact by driving positive change through my work. The love I have for working with data to influence decision makers and also make decisions began while I was working in finance and vendor management. I have experience using systems such as Workday, Adaptive Insights, Sage100, Cyrus ERP, Vizzlo, Excel and Raiser's Edge to analyze and report data. Prior to entering my graduate school program, I was working as a Technology Consultant in Cloud FinOps and IT Business Analysis where I further honed my data visualization skills for client presentations and executive summaries. I am hoping to gain further skills in data visualization and improve as an effective storyteller.  

My goal post graduation goal is to return to the Cloud FinOps Space. In a nutshell, I am studying Information Systems Management to hone my expertise in cloud cost management, FinOps, and technology-driven solutions by understanding information systems at their core.  Whether itâ€™s through FinOps assessments, cost optimization strategies, or building robust financial frameworks for the cloud, I would love to empower companies to innovate responsibly and effectively!


# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. I would like to begin sharpening my skillset with a number of tools as part of my experience including GitHub and Tableau
2. I hope to be a better visualizer and storyteller 
3. I would like to have increased patience with creating visuals and allow my selft to be creative without feeling rushed or unnecessary pressure

You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
