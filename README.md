# Welcome Message
Welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data!  Like a painter, this site will be my easel. I invite you to join the journey as I refine my data storytelling skills with the goal of bringing the skills gained into my next role. 

# About me
My name is Vimbai Muyengwa, and I am currently purusing a Master's in Information Systems Management at CMU. My career spans several industries including the manufacturing, non-profit, law, technology, and consulting realms. My journey into the tech world is uniquely non-traditional: I majored in Sociology during my undergraduate studies. This background profoundly shaped my worldview, instilling a deep commitment to making a meaningful impact by driving positive change through my work. The love I have for working with data to influence decision makers and also make decisions began while I was working in finance and vendor management. I have experience using systems such as Workday, Adaptive Insights, Sage100, Cyrus ERP, Vizzlo, Excel and Raiser's Edge to analyze and report data. Prior to entering my graduate school program, I was working as a Technology Consultant in Cloud FinOps and IT Business Analysis where I further honed my data visualization skills for client presentations and executive summaries. I am hoping to gain further skills in data visualization and improve as an effective storyteller.  

My goal post graduation plan is to return to the Cloud FinOps Space. In a nutshell, I am studying Information Systems Management to hone my expertise in cloud cost management, FinOps, and technology-driven solutions by understanding information systems at their core. In my future work, I would love to empower companies to innovate responsibly and effectively whether itâ€™s through FinOps assessments, cost optimization strategies, building robust financial frameworks for the cloud, or technical program management!


# What I hope to learn

1. I would like to begin sharpening my skillset with a number of tools as part of my experience including GitHub and Tableau
2. I hope to be a better visualizer and storyteller 
3. I would like to have increased patience with creating visuals and allow my selft to be creative without feeling rushed or unnecessary pressure
