# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
For my final project, I have decided to create a professional website that demonstrates my interests in returning to work in the Cloud FinOps space post-graduation. This website will showcases my skills and experience, and more importantly why Cloud cost optimization is a problem to be solved. I was introduced to the Cloud while working for the Association of American Medical Colleges in an IT Finance and Vendor Management capacity. My mentor saw a passion in me for technology and learning and told me to educate myself in all things cloud. I decided to become a certified AWS Cloud practitioner in 2021. 

When I was introduced to the cloud back in 2021, cloud roles were just beginning to surge in popularity. As more and more organizations migrated to the cloud, it presented a conundrum due to the nature of variable costs in the cloud. Organizations soon realized that the tradeoff for being able to quickly innovate was runaway cloud costs. In the last few years, Flexera has repeatedly reported Cloud cost optimization as a top two must have strategy of  IT organizationâ€™s operating in the cloud. 

My call to action: Gartner, a trusted Information technology report and insights firm has stated that that 90% of organizations will adopt hybrid Cloud through 2027 estimating a Total $723 billion end-user cloud spend in 2025 alone (Gartner). The cloud being a mainstay is even more evident as the increased popularity of the cloud coincides with the dawn of AI. 

In the end, I want to highlight the problem space and share how I can be part of the solution for a company looking to hire me. 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

My story Arch 

1.	Educate on cloud.  Brief history and What is it? Use Iphone analogy of cloud storage
a. Increase accessibility
b.	Cloud Benefits: Power to Innovate. Ability to Pay as you Go. Cloud and Sustainability
3.	The FinOps Problem and Solution 
a.	Rampant cloud costs 
b.	Organizations practicing Finops/ Those planning on establishing a CCOE
c.	Optimization and its benefits
4.	Call To Action
5.	My Expertise (Certifications, Coursework, Work Experience)  
6.	Close out with Unique Experience/Career Journey (From Sociology -> Technology) 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# Method and medium
I plan on competing my final project by gather data from trusted sources to support the need for Cloud FinOps practitioners. 
 	I will use Tableau, and Datawrapper to build my graphical models. Miro to build a skills map to showcase my current and future skills. 
	Python/ Jupyter notebooks to showcase my skills in Timeseries Forecasting
