# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

When I decided to create a professional website, the primary audience I had in mind was recruiters and companies seeking a deeper understanding of my expertise. I foresee that the potential users for my site will include hiring managers, recruiters, industry peers, and individuals in my network. As I developed my story, I realized that I needed to make my site accessible not only to industry peers but also to those without direct cloud experience. Increasing accessibility was the main piece of feedback I received from my peers throughout the development process. This feedback led me to incorporate more educational material about the cloud and its history.

Summary: The site is aimed at hiring managers, recruiters, industry professionals, and mentors/peers.

After watching Nancy Duarte’s TED Talk on how to tell a story, it became clear to me that I needed to begin by explaining the "what is" before diving into the "what could be." I tried to incorporate in the middle of the story the aspect of current state and the future possibilities, showing a back-and-forth progression. As I walk through my experiences and how they align with the broader narrative, I want to address any resistance or concerns from potential employers. Regarding presenting the world as a "new bliss," I plan to focus on the reduction of costs, optimization, and sustainable solutions as key benefits of cloud technology.

My next thought is how to create a compelling scene that will keep people engaged. I’m considering how visuals can be used to effectively communicate these concepts. After all, as Nancy Duarte suggests, the future is a place that I get to create, not just something we're headed toward.

I also spent some time reading the NY times Github site via  suggesting that the "most compelling timeline sotries have a narrative arc, and clearly highlight the turning points in the saga". 


## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask.
My goal is to create a professional platform that effectively communicates my expertise in Cloud FinOps and why cost optimization is a problem worth solving. I would like some feedback on how well the site achieves this goal\

| Goal                    | Questions to Ask                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Improve Content          | Does the content effectively communicate what Cloud FinOps is and why it’s important? |
| Improve Content          | Do you get a clear sense of my expertise and unique value in the field?           |
| Improve Content          | Is there anything unclear, missing, or that you’d like to see more of?            |
| First Impressions         | Does the website feel professional and polished? What elements enhance or take away from that impression? |
| Visual & User Experience | Do the visuals (charts, infographics, case studies) help explain the concepts, or do they need improvement? |
| Next Steps               | If you were a recruiter/hiring manager, would this website make you want to reach out? Why or why not? |


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

For my first interview, the feedback received was to provide more information on the cloud, so audience could have more context. 
I decided to create a historical timelin to showcase this. The interviewers also suggested I focus on projects and more less the nitty gritty technical details. 


| **Questions**                        | **Interview 1 (Briefly Describe)**                                          | **Interview 2**  | **Interview 3**  |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

| **Research Synthesis**                         | **Anticipated Changes for Part III**                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Additional information**         | Update the cloud information to explain more of the history of the cloud. Make it more detailed and accessible, incorporating educational material on cloud evolution and its significance. |
| **Hook Development**                      | Develop more of a hook. Perhaps a story on cloud storage and the iPhone and/or email accounts to set a baseline.               |
| **Developing My Story and Projects**      | Focus more on the projects I've completed over implementation.                                                                 |

| **Story Flow**                            | Ensure the story flows well; connect the dots in the narrative. Continue refining the structure based on feedback for Project II. |
| **Data Visualization**                    | Find a better way to represent the map and emphasize reflection incorporates *Good Charts* on chart persuasion or manipulation. |


| **Findings or Observations from Interviews**                                    | **Describe What, If Any Changes You Anticipate Making to Address the Observation** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Observation 1**: Some interviewees felt that the cloud's origin story could help add to the story.     | Revise content to offer a clearer historical perspective with milestones (completed). |
| **Observation 2**: Perhaps audience can benefit from how cloud services impact everyday life. | I mentioned in P1 how cloud is already part of our day to day (like iPhone or email storage) t. |
| **Observation 3**: Some feedback indicated that I needed to make sure the story did not veer off based on the multitude of narratives. | Improve transitions between sections, ensuring a smoother narrative and clearer links between personal projects and cloud evolution. |
| **Observation 4**: A few respondents found the content to be too long in the introductin. | Remove parts to ensure the core message is clear and concise (completed). |
| **Observation 6**: I should identify my hook to make draw audience in.      | Develop a stronger, more engaging hook by adding a relatable story (e.g., iPhone's integration with cloud services. I pay 2.99 for picture storage currently. Maybe a play in this area). |


> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

Putting myself under the microscope has proven to be a Herculean task. My goal is to remain transparent while also considering how to refine this project for future iterations, particularly for recruiters. In some ways, this process has helped me reflect on my overall career and the work I’ve done. I believe this self-reflection will better prepare me to navigate future opportunities.
