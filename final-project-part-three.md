# Changes made since Part II
**Story Arc**

The lead-up to my final project was a return to the original game plan. With each iteration, I experimented with different ways to present my story, but I ended up going back to my roots and initial outline. Starting out in project one, I imagined my story arc would start with rising cloud costs to open up the story. At this point, I knew that I should first detail the problem space and then share how I should solve that problem. By Part II, I thought the reception would be more strategic if I introduced myself and my expertise first before introducing the problem space. I had in mind to create a sort of sandwich of information, with me sharing my experience and expertise. From requesting feedback, this ordering proved to be somewhat confusing, so I decided to create a new draft of my Shorthand and recraft the ordering to the original. I also reordered other items such as putting History of the cloud after the Cloud FinOps and Sustainability section. As part of my feedback, I wanted to ensure the story flowed well and that audience members could easily connect the dots in the narrative.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2b4bc8-9e0b-41bf-a9cb-326e7d2961fa" />

After receiving feedback for Part II of the project, I was really itching to create something that could truly resonate with the audience. I decided to incorporate in media res, which is beginning the “narrative in the heat of the action. (Sparkol)” To start, the title declares there is a billion-dollar-sized problem. The next question would be, how big is this problem? In the next section, I think the first graphical presentation comparing 2024 and 2025 spend does this effectively. As suggested by Sparkol, I thought this set up would help the audience "crave the solution", which is Cloud FinOps.


**Skills Outline Change**
In Part I of the project, I initially had a spider diagram to detail my skillset, broken out into quantitative analysis, strategy, technical, and communication skills. It also detailed my career title and pathway—where I am and where I want to go. With the introduction of Shorthand, I realized I could more effectively outline these skillsets by visually representing them with a timeline. I thought this could effectively show my career journey and highlight my pathway. Here I really leaned into highlighting my career turning points in chronological order and using a “narrative arc” per the Financial Times (Kwong, R).

For Part III, I decided to specifically call out my career timeline journey as a transition from strictly Business to Technology and Business. I think this callout will be essential in telling my story and providing more context about the work I have done to get here.

### Final Design Decisions

**Gartner Worldwide Public Cloud Services End-User Spending Forecast**:
For my original bar chart, I had blue and orange for my bars. However, I thought about how best to complement the rest of my site. The colors I landed on were crème/maroon. At this point, I was thinking about how to use color (Good Charts Workbook, pg. 15). The goal in mind was to make it complementary. Something I had to keep in mind when I thought about changing the title of the chart to show an alarming color, like red, for the dramatic effect of a billion dollar problem. However, I quickly realized it was best to stick to the variables and keep the text black to keep it simple and variables streamlined. (Good Charts).

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1740702193633' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Gartner Worldwide Public Cloud Services End-User Spending Forecast, 2024-2025 (Billions of U.S. Dollars)Source: Gartner ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ga&#47;GartnerTableComparisons_V2&#47;GartnerForecast&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='GartnerTableComparisons_V2&#47;GartnerForecast' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ga&#47;GartnerTableComparisons_V2&#47;GartnerForecast&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                   
 var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1740702193633');                    
var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

Additionally, I also thought about creating a different type of chart with the data provided. Perhaps a table would have been best. I experimented with this in Tableau but ultimately decided to lean into how people think and use a bar chart to show the change year over year to respect convention (Good Charts Workbook, page 48).

**Initial Sketches**:
My initial sketch included an end-user projected spend cost in billions, showing just a simple diagram as shown below. My thought process in presenting the information this way was to just have a sticker shock value standing out for cloud spend in 2025. What I found was that the second graph showing the comparison of 2024 and 2025 told a better story because you can see the different types of cloud costs versus the orginal which does not tell us much apart from the exorbitant spend:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1740777318679' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Gartner Worldwide Public Cloud End-User Projected 2025 Spending (In Billions)  ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ga&#47;GartnerCloudEnd-UserProjectedSpendinginBillions&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='GartnerCloudEnd-UserProjectedSpendinginBillions&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ga&#47;GartnerCloudEnd-UserProjectedSpendinginBillions&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>

 var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';

 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

**Global FinOps Jobs**

The original global FinOps Job board showed the map of countries with FinOps jobs. I wanted to find a better way to represent the map. I really thought about Good Charts' persuasion or manipulation tactics for graphs. The orginal made did not take into account the actual job count across countries for open roles. I decided to change this chart to not only show FinOps jobs globally but also present a true picture of the actual job count in different countries. For the description of the graph, I leaned into describing ideas, not structure (Good Charts Workbook, page 48). I thought presenting the data to show insights into U.S. FinOps proliferation and tell the story of how the U.S. is leading in FinOps adoption.

<img width="248" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80c7a410-473a-4952-a138-d248c9e0b9f1" />


I decided to recreate the map graph using Tableau instead as I thought the interactive piece with the map could be interesting. If this evolves overtime it can show different data points of the countries and jobs listed. Part of what we learned in Good charts was that you should try and create reusable charts whose data can be iteratively improved to tell a different story or include richer data. After transitioning to tableau, I did hit a hurdle with the way the rgaphs were showing up in preview. I did some troubleshooting alone, and in the classroom before the professor provided the solution. I spent time rearranging and electing templates within my presentation that I could utilize the rich embed code instead of creating a section with HTML code.

**Section Removals and Edits**
From part II I removed what seemed to be a second title from Part II exclaiming “A Billion Dollar Size Challenge” as it seemed a bit out of place with the grainy picture and did not cohesively blend into the rest of the page. I took the “Cloud FinOps Expertise and Consulting” title and decided to state the exact problem and Cloud FinOps as a solution. By removing the second title, the new title became Cloud FinOps: A Strategic Solution to a Billion-Dollar-Sized Problem. I realized that the beginning needed to state exactly what Cloud FinOps was. I think this evolved from the first project and title, Welcome to My Page, as I began to crystallize that I did not need to make myself the center of the story but rather Cloud FinOps itself.

**"IT Spending Billions of Dollars" Chart**

Using Datawrapper, I highlighted the 1,377 in 2028 to emphasize and isolate the year and amount using the highlighting visualization tactic (Good Charts, 131). Here, I highlighted the 2028 statistic showing a steady increase. I also ordered the graph in descending order naturally, as it shows an incremental increase year over year. My graph shows the different types of cloud costs, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. I used different variations of the color swatch “#fa8c00” from Datawrapper to differentiate, complement, and contrast these different types of cloud (Good Charts Workbook, page 15).


**For the "Top Challenges for Companies Operating in the Cloud" section,** 
I initially used a stacked bar chart to present the data, as it helped account for the various factors. However, I decided to switch to split bars for better clarity. The stacked bars made the ranks blend together, while the new design provides a clearer representation. The split bars effectively group the ranks and have been sorted by enterprise, small/medium business (SMB), and a category for all, making the information easier to understand. I focused on improving clarity with this update.

<br>
<br>
As a part of the larger narrative, after outlining the runaway cost. **For "The FinOps Solution and Sustainability"** section, I wanted to tie in some statistics around the global adoption of FinOps.I used brown soft tones for this to continue with overall theme of the charts. I also provided a statics on cost reduction. Here I used gray because it is an effective way to give emphasis for information to be highlighted in this case it was 30% of costs to be reduced and the what is background information (Good Charts Workbook, page 15). 

<iframe title="Achieving Cost Reduction through Reducing Waste" aria-label="Election Donut" id="datawrapper-chart-uoaZq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uoaZq/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="249" data-external="1"></iframe>

To hone in on the sustainability and waste reduction, II created a Tableau packed bubbles chart that shows IT related electricity usage without efficiency being 31% globally. I decided to focus on how the story would be more persuasive by comparing strictly the Electricity usage with and without efficiency. As such, I took out the CO2 data which was previously shown in iteration wo because it did not add an imperative dimension to the story.

**Cloud Imagery Design changes:**
In the second part of the project, I utilized image of actual clouds and weaved it into the story. as I thought more about it and polished my website, I realized that this was not the most effective way for me to talk about the cloud. I reasoned that I do not want people to associate the cloud with actual clouds or have those two things synonymously coupled. 

<br>
For my pie chart illustrated in **Call to Action**: I changed the color of the pie chart and then made sure to highlight the area of data we wanted to show using color. For the section that should be the focus, I used a deeper toned reddish color and made the other section ligher. I also highligted the section to highlight

<br>
<br>
**Overall Layout of Website**
I changed the overall layout to experiment after my Tableau graphs weren't showing up in published mode. I'm not entirely sure if it resolved the issue, but I could see them intermittently when I edited the layout. After testing the link with others, they were able to see the graphs, though on my end, they would only appear occasionally. Interestingly, I also noticed that the new layout improved the mobile view!

## The audience

The audience for my final data story remains the same as part II. Since this is a professional website, the primary audience will be recruiters and companies seeking Cloud FinOps expertise. The potential users for my site will be hiring managers, recruiters, industry peers, and individuals in my network. From the beginning, the main audience was clear—companies and industry peers would be able to consume my site and understand the inner workings/technical jargon of what I was sharing.

Where I needed to refine my approach was for those in the audience who may not be as familiar with cloud concepts. Insights from my user interviews helped me tailor the content to be more accessible. I revisited my initial idea from Part I, where I used iPhone iCloud storage as an analogy to make cloud computing more relatable. Some interviewees, particularly those in non-technical studies, expressed that they found cloud computing abstract and difficult to connect to everyday life. To bridge this gap, I revisited my initial idea from Part I, where I used iPhone iCloud storage as an analogy to make cloud concepts more relatable. This analogy resonated with audience I believe when I did my presentation, as most people were familiar with running out of iCloud storage but haven’t necessarily considered how cloud services impact them beyond their personal devices! For additional accessbility, though not presented in class, I also kept Cloud History section as I saw it as a way to incorporate key milestones in cloud development, making the story more informative for a broader audience.

In Shorthand, I considered the best way to represent this concept visually and decided to use a scrollmation effect. This feature transitions an image of an iPhone into an iCloud storage message displaying “Not enough cloud storage.” I thought this would be an engaging way to not only describe the concept but also visualize it for those who may not be familiar with that message.

# Final thoughts
This project was challenging in the best way. The iterative progression and constant feedback were incredibly helpful. There was a moment toward the end when I felt overwhelmed and briefly considered that I could have chosen an easier subject than myself. However, now that I’m reaching the finish line, it has been so rewarding.

I wish I had the chance to revisit creating visualizations using Raw Graphs. Of all the tools, this was the one I would have loved to practice more with because of its unique and exciting visualizations. The part I was most excited about was the Shorthand website—it’s so slick, clean, and smooth. I even showed it to someone outside of our class as a tester, and they were really impressed. It took everything in me to admit that the polished look was thanks to the Shorthand tool.

As you mentioned at the beginning of the class, there comes a point where you have to stop yourself because you could keep refining and researching indefinitely. I really tried to refer back to Good Charts as my guide when making decisions about my visualizations and the overall structure of the website.
