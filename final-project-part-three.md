# Changes made since Part II
The lead-up to my final project was a return to the original game plan. With each iteration, I experimented with different ways to present my story, but I ended up going back to my roots and initial outline. Starting out in project one, I imagined my story arc would start with riding cloud costs to open up the story. At this point, I knew that I should first detail the problem space and then share how I should solve that problem. By Part II, I thought the reception would be more strategic if I introduced myself and my expertise first before introducing the problem space. I had in mind to create a sort of sandwich ending, with me sharing my experience and expertise. From requesting feedback, this ordering proved to be somewhat confusing, so I decided to create a new draft of my Shorthand and recraft the ordering to the original.

In Part I of the project, I initially had a spider diagram to detail my skillset, broken out into quantitative analysis, strategy, technical, and communication skills. It also detailed my career title and pathway—where I am and where I want to go. With the introduction of Shorthand, I realized I could more effectively outline these skillsets by visually representing them with a timeline. I thought this could effectively show my career journey and highlight my pathway. I leaned into highlighting my career turning points in chronological order and using a “narrative arc” per the Financial Times.

For Part III, I decided to specifically call out my career timeline journey as a transition from strictly Business to Technology and Business. I think this callout will be essential in telling my story and providing more context about the work I have done to get here.


## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The audience since Part II has not changed. Since this is a professional website, the primary audience will be recruiters and companies seeking Cloud FinOps expertise. The potential users for my site will be hiring managers, recruiters, industry peers, and individuals in my network. From the beginning, the main audience was clear—companies and industry peers would be able to consume my site and understand the inner workings of what I was sharing.

Where I needed to develop was for those in the audience who were not so familiar with the cloud context. My user interviews helped me to better develop the content for them. I thought about revisiting my initial idea in Part I, where I tied the cloud back to people’s usage of iPhone iCloud storage as an analogy that the audience could connect to.

In Shorthand, I thought about how best to represent this, so I used a scrollmation to show the iPhone and have the image transition into the iCloud storage message showing “Not enough cloud storage.” I thought this would be a cool way to not just describe but visualize the concept for those who may or may not know what that message looks like.



## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

Final Design Decisions
I have returned to the original format, listing out the history of the cloud after Cloud FinOps and Sustainability. As part of my feedback, I wanted to ensure the story flowed well and that audience members could easily connect the dots in the narrative.

After receiving feedback for Part II of the project, I was really itching to create something that could truly resonate with the audience. I decided to incorporate in media res, which is beginning the “narrative in the heat of the action.” The title declares there is a billion-dollar-sized problem. The next question would be, how big is this problem? I think the first graphical presentation comparing 2024 and 2025 does this effectively. I thought maybe it could help the audience crave the solution, which is Cloud FinOps.

For my original bar chart, I had blue and orange for my bars. However, I thought about how best to complement the rest of my site. The colors I landed on were crème/maroon. At this point, I was thinking about how to use color (Good Charts Workbook, pg. 15). The goal in mind was to make it complementary. I thought about changing the title of the chart to show an alarming color, like red, for the text. However, I quickly realized it was best to stick to the variables (Good Charts).

var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';

</script>


At this point, I also thought about creating a different type of chart with the data provided. Perhaps a table would have been best. I experimented with this in Tableau but ultimately decided to lean into how people think and use a bar chart to show the change year over year to respect convention (Good Charts Workbook, page 48).

Initial Sketches
My initial sketch included an end-user projected spend cost in billions, showing just a simple diagram like this. My thought process in presenting the information this way was to just have a sticker shock value standing out for cloud spend in 2025. What I found was that the second graph showing the comparison of 2024 and 2025 told a better story.

<img width="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43c3d51-785d-4e5e-9f94-9f43c842db35" />

The global FinOps job board showed the map of countries with FinOps jobs. I wanted to find a better way to represent the map and emphasize reflection incorporating Good Charts on chart persuasion or manipulation. I decided to change this chart to not only show FinOps jobs globally but also present a true picture of the actual job count in different countries. Here, I leaned into describing ideas, not structure (Good Charts Workbook, page 48). I decided to present the data to show insights into U.S. FinOps proliferation and tell the story of how the U.S. is leading in FinOps adoption.

I decided to recreate the MAP graph using Tableau insead as I thought the interactive piece with the map could be interesting if this evolved overtime showing different data points of the countries and jobs listed. Part of what we learned in Good charts was that you should try and create reusable or charts whose data can be iteratively improved to tell a different story or include richer data. After transitioning to tableau, I did hit a hurdle with the way the raphs were showing up in preview. I did some troubleshooting alone, and in the classroom before the professor provided the solution. I spent time rearranging and electing templates within my presentation that I could utilize the rich embed code instead of creating a section with HTML code.

var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);

I removed what seemed to be a second title from Part II exclaiming “A Billion Dollar Size Challenge” as it seemed a bit out of place with the grainy picture and did not cohesively blend into the rest of the page. I took the “Cloud FinOps Expertise and Consulting” title and decided to state the exact problem and Cloud FinOps as a solution. By removing the second title, the new title became Cloud FinOps: A Strategic Solution to a Billion-Dollar-Sized Problem. I realized that the beginning needed to state exactly what Cloud FinOps was. I think this evolved from the first project and title, Welcome to My Page, as I began to crystallize that I did not need to make myself the center of the story but rather Cloud FinOps itself.

A huge part of showing the 1,377 was to emphasize and isolate it as a visualization tactic (Good Charts, 131) using Datawrapper. Here, I highlighted the 2028 statistic showing a steady increase. I also ordered the graph in descending order naturally, as it shows an incremental increase year over year. My graph shows the different types of cloud costs, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. I used different variations of the color swatch “#fa8c00” from Datawrapper to differentiate, complement, and contrast these different types of cloud (Good Charts Workbook, page 15).

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7435b19b-e01c-4ea1-b655-57ee75df1503" />

For the "Top Challenges for Companies Operating in the Cloud" section, I initially used a stacked bar chart to present the data, as it helped account for the various factors. However, I decided to switch to split bars for better clarity. The stacked bars made the ranks blend together, while the new design provides a clearer representation. The split bars effectively group the ranks and have been sorted, making the information easier to understand. I focused on improving clarity with this update.

<iframe title="Top Challenges for Companies Operating in the Cloud " aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-A4gVp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A4gVp/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="844" height="404" data-external="1"></iframe>

As a part of the larger narrative, after outlining the runaway cost. The FinOps Solution and Sustainability, I wanted to tie in some statistics around the global adoption of FinOps and showcase current pages 
I used brown soft tones for this to continue with overall theme of the charts. I also provided a statics on cost reduction. Here I used gray because it is an effective way to give emphasis for information to be highlighted in this case it was 30% of costs to be reduced and the what is background information (Good Charts Workbook, page 15). 

<iframe title="Achieving Cost Reduction through Reducing Waste" aria-label="Election Donut" id="datawrapper-chart-uoaZq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uoaZq/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="249" data-external="1"></iframe>

To hone in on the sustainability and waste deduction, i created a tableau packed bubbles chart that hsows IT related electricity usage without efficiency being 31% globally. I decided to focus on how the story would be more persuasive by comparing strictly the Electricity usage with and without efficiency. I took out the CO2 data because it did not cohesively tell the sotry.
